# Empirica Core

The Core Empirica package contains everything needed to run an experiment with
the Empirica platform.

Setting up an experiment requires more than just this package, so we've created
a simple way to create a new Empirica app.

Check out https://github.com/empiricaly/create-empirica-app for details on how
to get started!
